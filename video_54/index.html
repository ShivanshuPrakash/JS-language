    <h1> What is a Promise?</h1>
    <pre>
       
A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion
or failure of an asynchronous operation. It has three possible states:

Pending: The promise is still in progress.
Fulfilled: The promise has been successfully completed (via resolve).
Rejected: The promise has failed (via reject).

    </pre>
    <h3>" new Promise " --- >  Key-word</h3>
    <pre>
This creates a new Promise object.
The constructor takes a function (called the executor) as an argument. This function receives two parameters:
resolve: A function to call if the promise is fulfilled successfully.
reject: A function to call if the promise encounters an error or fails.
    </pre>
    <pre>
       <h3> What is resolve?</h3>
    </pre>
    <pre>
resolve is a function provided by JavaScript when you create a new Promise.
Calling resolve(value):
Transitions the promise from the pending state to the fulfilled state.
Passes the value (in this case, 56) to any .then() callbacks attached to the promise
    </pre>
    <h4>
        <pre>
Summary

The resolve function is the mechanism to indicate the successful completion of a promise and pass
the result to the next step in your asynchronous workflow. In your case, resolve(56) fulfilled
the promise and stored 56 as its resolved value, even though it was not used further in the code.

    Applications of Promises in JavaScript
</h1>
<pre>
Fetching Data from APIs
Used with fetch or libraries like axios to make HTTP requests and handle server responses asynchronously.

File Handling in Node.js
Read, write, or manipulate files asynchronously to avoid blocking the event loop.

Chaining Asynchronous Operations
Used to run multiple asynchronous tasks in sequence, such as processing data after fetching it.

Error Handling
Promises allow structured error handling using .catch(), simplifying debugging in asynchronous workflows.

Timers and Delays
Manage timeouts or intervals asynchronously using setTimeout wrapped in promises.

Database Operations
Interact with databases (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) for queries, ensuring non-blocking interactions.

Web Scraping
Used in scraping tools to handle asynchronous requests and responses from websites.

Event Handling
Manage complex event-driven logic, such as waiting for multiple events to resolve (using Promise.all).

Background Processing
Used in background tasks like uploading files, sending emails, or long-running computations.

Building Web Applications
Ensure smooth user experiences by handling asynchronous UI updates or animations.


Promises simplify managing asynchronous tasks and make the code more readable and maintainable.
