//  You can change variable type in js during runtime  therefour
// java script is called dynamically typed language 
console.log('JavaScript is called a dynamically typed language because you dont need to declare the data type of a variable when you create it, and a variables type can change at runtime. This means. No need to define types: When you create a variable, you dont specify whether its a number, string, or any other type. This is different from statically typed languages (like C, Java), where you must declare the type of a variable (e.g., int, string) when you create it, and that type cant change. In short, JavaScript is flexible with how variables are used, which makes it dynamically typed');

console.log("Remember javaScript is case sensitive language");

// var V/S let  
// Var ha function scope whereas let is block scoped 
// if var is hosted and we dont initialized it and try to print it it shows undefined where as in case of let if it is hosted and not initalized throws error 
// var is more prone to bugs  due to its broad scope. therefore we use let insted of var
// you can redeclare a var in same scope but cant redeclare a let in same scope
