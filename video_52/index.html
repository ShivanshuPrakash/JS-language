    <div class="sync"><pre><h1>Synchronous Function</h1>
        A synchronous function executes sequentially, meaning one task is completed before the next one starts. 
        The program waits for the current task to finish before moving on. This is straightforward
        but can block the execution of other tasks, especially if the current task takes time
        (e.g., reading a large file).</pre>
    </div>
    <div class="async"><pre><h1>Asynchronous Function</h1>
        An asynchronous function allows the program to initiate a task and move on to the next one without waiting 
        for the previous one to complete. The result of the asynchronous task is handled later, usually via
        callbacks, promises, or async/await.
    </pre></div>
</div>
<div class="call"><pre><h1>Callback Function</h1>
    A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later,
    typically after the completion of a specific task or event. It is a key concept in asynchronous programming,
    especially in JavaScript.</pre></div>
